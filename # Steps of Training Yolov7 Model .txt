# Steps of Training Yolov7 Model 

1) Create virtual environment 


2) Prepare Dataset
- Image Annotation can be done by LabelImg 
- Image Annotation (format of yolo , if you have pascal you can convert it to yolo)

- Create 2 folder  : train and validation  
	train/
	  - images/
	  - labels/
	validation/
	  - images/
	  - labels/

- Split your images and labels to those folders
- Labels and image names must be same for same instance for example : 
	money1.jpeg(image file) --> this must be inside of train/images/
	money1.txt (label file) --> this must be inside of train/labels/


3) Prepare official Yolo repository 

- Download yolo repository and extract it and give it a name like yolocustom

- Inside of repository open requirements.txt and find proper pyTorch version
- Delete pyTorch and torchvision lines in requirements.txt and save that file
-  proper pyTorch version will be used in another txt file , check below

- Create a new text file for torch installation with GPU (requirements_gpu.txt)
-   proper pyTorch version : 
	# example version
	-i https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
	torch==2.1.0 
	torchvision==0.16.0 
- in anaconda prompt go yolo custom directory that you created and run following line :
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt (this will install pytorch with cuda support)

4) Modify Yolo files
-Move train sets to the yolocustom/data (yolocustom is folder that you create)
- make a copy of coco.yaml to custom_data.yaml(you can change give whatever name you want but in terminal you need to write proper name) 
- open custom_data.yaml and define train and validation folder , define class number and class names
- find cfg folder inside of yolocustom and copy the model that you want , make a copy of that model(.yaml) and change the name yolo_custom.yaml and open that file and make some adjustments (class number) , save file
- download weights for yolo model and move them to the your custom directory yolocustom

5) Training Model 
- Open terminal and go to your custom model directory
	# run this file but be aware of names , if you create files with different names change them
	python train.py --workers 1 --device 0 --batch-size 8 --epochs 100 --img 640 640 --	data data/custom_data.yaml --hyp data/hyp.scratch.custom.yaml --cfg 	cfg/training/yolov7-	custom.yaml --name yolov7-custom --weights yolov7.pt

6) Test model 
	# yolo_money_best.pt --> best model 
	# image file --> test3.jpeg , you can test videos like images
	python detect.py --weights yolo_money_best.pt --conf 0.5 --img-size 640 --source 	test3.jpeg --no-trace
